Steps to building my game.....



FACE DOWN
Steps 1 - 3:
First to play the game I must shuffle all the tiles and lay it in a rectangle grid face down, then i define the tiles with a function.

Next I must create a for loop so it's easy to create coordinate for the grid. Declare an empty tile array to store tiles.

The outer loop repeats the columns we want, and the inner loop repeats the rows and each new tile is set with a value of v and g to match the columns and rows.

FACE UP (Assigning image)
Step 4 - 8:
There must be 2 of every imagine in the array randomly distributed.

First we must create an array of the possible images, using the getImage function from my library.

Only need 4 images for the face of 8 tiles, so I must create a new array thata hold 2 copies of 4 randomly selceted images from the first array.

In the for loop where I created the tiles, I'll assign an image from that array to each tile.
